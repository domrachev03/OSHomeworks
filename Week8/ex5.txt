Virtual memory is an abstraction on physical memory. It is needed to provide more
convinient interface for programs to work with the memory.

Some of differences:
1. Virtual adresses are unique for each process. And then, they are mapped to physical adress.

2. Virtual adresses can be bigger than memory available. This is possible, since not
all virtual memory adresses has to be linked with real memory (since it is not used)
